%       ecog.sentTemplates: A cell structure with N items representing the
%                           N sentences we're classifying.  In each
%                           structure is a PxQ matrix of P timepoints by Q
%                           frequency bands.  You can then compare this
%                           matrix to the Q frequency bands of each
%                           reconstruction.

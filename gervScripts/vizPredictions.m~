%  This function assists with visualizing the predictions                
% It takes as input a frequency, block, and sentence stimulus to compare the
% actual audio to the predicted audio.
%   INPUTS:
%           freq                : specified frequency
%           testBlock           : block to test
%           stim                : sentence to test against
%           numStims            : how many sentences are there total?
%           templates           : pointer to a cell array with templates
%           predictions         : pointer to a cell array with predictions
